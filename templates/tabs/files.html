<p>
  Publicly accessible files of the WordPress core. Could possible be used to
  circumvent the WordPress security. They can be deleted savely.
</p>

<p>
  Crossed out file names are no longer on the server hard drive. Either
  because they were already deleted during a manual or automatic deletion, or
  because they were not included in your WordPress installation at all.
